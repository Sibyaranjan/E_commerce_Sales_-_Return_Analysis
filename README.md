# E_Commerce_Sales_and_Return_Analysis
# Project Overview:-

The E-Commerce Sales & Return Analysis project aims to analyze sales performance, profitability, and return trends across different regions, products, and sales channels. The insights derived from this analysis help in identifying high-performing products, understanding customer return patterns, and improving business profitability.

This project involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Power BI Dashboard for interactive insights.

# Project Workflow
# 1️ Data Collection & Cleaning

Imported raw sales and return data from Excel files.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types using Pandas.

Extracted year, month, and day features from order dates.

# 2️ Data Analysis

Performed descriptive statistics (mean, median, total revenue, and profit).

Created calculated metrics like Profit Margin %, Total Orders, and Revenue by Channel.

Analyzed top-performing products, states, and years.

# 3️ Data Visualization

Built Python visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for profit trends and correlations.

Designed a Power BI Dashboard for dynamic and interactive insights.

# Dashboard Insights

The Power BI dashboard provides the following key insights:

Total Revenue: 1.24 Billion

Total Profit: 1.14 Billion

Total Orders: 11K

Average Profit Margin: 92.57%

Top Performing Products: Displayed by total profit

Profit by Channel: Wholesale (54%), Distributor (31%), Export (15%)

Profit by Year: Steady growth until 2017 with a drop in 2018

Revenue by State: California, Illinois, and Florida are top contributors
